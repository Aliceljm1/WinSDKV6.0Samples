This sample shows how to use the video processor in DirectX Video 
Acceleration (DXVA) 2.

The sample programatically generates video with a primary stream
and a substream. The video is then processed and displayed 
using a DXVA2 video processor.

The user can change the planar alpha values, source and destination
rectangles, color adjustments, and color space. For a list of the
command-line arguments and keyboard commands, see the comments in
the file dxva2vp.cpp.
