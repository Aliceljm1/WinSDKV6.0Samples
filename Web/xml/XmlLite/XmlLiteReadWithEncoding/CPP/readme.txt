Overview
--------
This sample illustrates how to implement an XmlLite application that reads an XML document with encoding.
Included with the sample is an XML document that is encoded with UTF-16.

XmlLite Documentation
---------------------
You can find the documentation for XmlLite in XMLLite.hxs in the Help directory of the SDK.

Requirements
------------
This sample requires the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows Vista and
.NET Framework 3.0. XmlLite samples require the XmlLite.h and XmlLite.lib files to build. XmlLite
samples require XmlLite.dll to run.

How to Build this Sample
------------------------
Build the sample using the latest Windows SDK. You can use Visual Studio to build the sample. If you do not
have Visual Studio installed, you can use the VCBuild utility to build the sample. In the sample directory,
enter the command VCBuild with no command line arguments.

How to Run this Sample
----------------------
Once you have built the sample, you can run it from the command line as follows:

release\XmlLiteReadWithEncoding encoded.xml
