Description:
The DHTML Editing control provides a full-featured WYSIWYG HTML editor as a control that you can add to any application. This particular sample shows the DHTML Editing control hosted in a document called fulledit.htm - in other words, it shows a Web page that allows you to edit other Web pages.
When you run the sample, most of the document's client area is taken up by the DHTML Editing control, where you can enter and edit text. You can apply most the control's editing commands using the toolbar, a context menu, and dialog boxes (all implemented in DHTML). The sample shows you how you can activate and inactivate toolbar buttons depending on the current state of the selection or document.
To create a new HTML document, just start typing. Save your document with commands from the File menu. Or enter the URL for any document on any Web site into the URL box, and when the document appears, you can edit away.
Note:  The DHTML Editing control is downloaded to your computer when you run the sample.
