    The iSCSI sample demonstrates the apis used to configure and manage the iSCSI initiator services. iSCSI is a technology that allows an initiator computer to use SCSI devices that reside on another machine across a TCP/IP network. The iSCSI initiator apis are implmented in iscsidsc.dll and defined in iscsidsc.h. 

    The iscsicli sample is the source code for the iscsicli command line utility that ships with the iSCSI initiator service package. It allows access to all features of the iSCSI initiator service and serves as a guide for how to use the iScsi Initiator apis implemented in iscsidsc.dll.
