    This sample illustrates how to programmatically retrieve IPv4 configuration
    information similar to the IPCONFIG.EXE utility.  It demonstrates how to use
    the IP Helper APIs GetNetworkParams and GetAdaptersInfo function.  Note that the GetAdaptersInfo function only retrieves IPv4 information.

    To execute this application, simply build the application using the Microsoft Visual C++
    (Version 5 SP 3 or newer) nmake.exe program generation utility to make an executable
    ipconfig.exe.  After the build is complete, simply execute the resulting ipconfig.exe
    program.

Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 98
