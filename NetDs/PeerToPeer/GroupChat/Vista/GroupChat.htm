<H3>Using the Group Chat Sample Application</H3>


</b>The Group Chat Sample Application demonstrates how to create a chat 
application based on the Peer-to-Peer Grouping and Identity Manager API.&nbsp; 
In order to use Group Chat the following steps must be followed:</p>
<p><b>1. Creating a Peer Identity for each user, and saving this information</b><br>
In the Group Chat sample application, a user can generate an identity by 
selecting the &quot;Create…&quot; option on the &quot;Identity&quot; menu.&nbsp; The resulting 
dialog box prompts the user for the friendly name (in this case the &quot;chat name&quot;) 
that will be associated with the new identity<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">.&nbsp; 
Before a group can be created, an identity associated with the group creator 
needs to be created.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Creating a group that will host the chat participants</b><br>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Once the group owner has an identity, a group is 
created by selecting the &quot;Create…&quot; option on the &quot;Group&quot; menu. The resulting 
dialog prompts the user for the identity of the group creator, as well as the 
name of the group to be created and associated with the chosen identity.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><b>3. Creating participants’ identity information files for invitations</b><i><br>
</i>Once the chat group has been created, chat members can solicit the group 
owner for invitations to join the group. An invitation consists of an XML data 
string derived from a unique identity (as created in step 1).&nbsp; An 
invitation is thus exclusively bound to a particular identity.&nbsp; The group 
owner uses the Peer-to-Peer Grouping API to generate an invitation from an 
identity and then returns this invitation to the user requesting permission to 
join the group.</p>
<p>Users that wish to join the chat group create user identities the same way 
that the group owner identity is created, using the &quot;Create…&quot; option on 
&quot;Identity&quot; menu. The &quot;Identity&quot; menu also allows the user to save this identity 
information to a file.&nbsp; This file is then sent out of band of the 
peer-to-peer infrastructure to the group owner, who creates the corresponding 
invitation.</p>
<p><b>4. Creating the invitations to join the group to chat</b><i><br>
</i>Once the group owner receives a file containing a user’s identity 
information, they can create a file containing an invitation to join the group 
using the Create Invitation… item on the Group menu. Selecting this option 
opens the Create Invitation dialog, which prompts the user to specify the 
location of the identity information (.idt) file, as well as the destination of 
the invitation information (.inv) file.&nbsp; The invitation file is then sent 
out of band of the peer-to-peer infrastructure to the requesting individual.</p>
<p>It is important to note that invitations created with the Group Chat 
application demonstrate how to create invitations for the &quot;Member&quot; role.&nbsp; A 
group participant with a member role cannot issue invitations.&nbsp; Only 
participants with &quot;Admin&quot; credentials can create invitations.&nbsp; For an 
example of how to create &quot;Admin&quot; invitations, please see the Group Browser demo.</p>
<p><b>5. Joining the Chat Group</b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><br>
In order to join the chat group, a user needs to have a predefined identity as 
well as the invitation file that corresponds to that identity.&nbsp; If these 
two requirements are satisfied, the &quot;Join…&quot; option on the &quot;Group&quot; menu can be 
used to join the group. Selecting this option opens the Join Group dialog, which 
requires the user to select his identity and&nbsp; location of the invitation 
(.inv) file. Pressing the &quot;Ok&quot; button initiates the join process.&nbsp; If this 
is successful, the chat app will connect to the group and the chat user will be 
online<b>.</b></span></p>
<p><b>6. Whispering to other members<br>
</b>To carry on a private conversation with another member, simply double-click 
that member in the 'Chat Members' list.&nbsp; The following dialog will allow 
the user to send a &quot;whisper&quot; message to the selected member.</p>
