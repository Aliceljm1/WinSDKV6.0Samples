<h3>Graph Chat</H3>
The Graph Chat Sample Application is a simple chat application demonstrating how to use the Peer-to-Peer Graphing API and the Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP) namespace provider with the Winsock2 API.  More specifically the application demonstrates:

<UL>
    <LI>Graph creation
    <LI>Connecting to an existing graph
    <LI>Disconnecting from an existing graph
    <LI>The enumeration utilities
    <LI>How to add records to the graph
    <LI>How to use direct connections
    <LI>How to use the notifications and event infrastructure
    <LI>How to register names in PNRP
    <LI>How to resolve names in PNRP
    <LI>How to unregister names in PNRP
</UL>

<H3>Group Chat</H3>
The Group Chat Sample Application is a simple chat application demonstrating how to use the Peer-to-Peer Grouping and Identity Manager API.  More specifically the application demonstrates:

<UL>
    <LI>Identity creation
    <LI>Identity information creation
    <LI>Enumeration of identities
    <LI>Enumeration of groups associated with an identity
    <LI>Creating a group
    <LI>Creating invitations for a group
    <LI>Connecting to an existing group
    <LI>Disconnecting from an existing group
    <LI>Extracting information from group properties
    <LI>How to use direct connections
    <LI>Using the enumeration utilities
    <LI>Enumeration through group membership
    <LI>How to add records to the group
    <LI>How to use notifications and event infrastructure
</UL>

<H3>Group Browser</H3>
The Group Browser Sample Application is a simple management tool that demonstrates how to use the Peer-to-Peer Grouping and Identity Manager API.  More specifically the application demonstrates:

<UL>
    <LI>Enumerating PNRP Clouds
    <LI>Enumerating Identities
    <LI>Enumerating groups associated with an identity
    <LI>How to create and delete identities
    <LI>Create a group and associate it with an identity
    <LI>Create an invitation and save it to disk
    <LI>Open an invitation and use it to create a group and associate it with an identity
    <LI>Leave a group (delete identity and membership)
    <LI>Connect to an existing group
    <LI>Disconnect from an existing group
    <LI>Extract information from Group properties
    <LI>Use the enumeration utilities
    <LI>How to enumerate through group membership
    <LI>How to use notifications and event infrastructure
</UL>

<H3>Contact Sample</H3>
The Contact sample is a console based application.  The goal of the application
is to demonstrate proper use the the Collaboration Contact APIs.  Specifically,
it demonstrates how to:
<UL>
    <LI>Enumerate contacts
    <LI>Enumerate the applications associated with a contact
    <LI>Give a contact permission to watch you for presence changes
    <LI>Watch a contact's presence changes
    <LI>Export your contact information
    <LI>Import a contact
</UL>

<H3>People Near Me</H3>
The people near me sample is a simple console based application.  The goal
of the application is to demonstrate proper use of the Collaboration People
Near Me APIs.  Specifically, it demonstrates how to:
<UL>
    <LI>Enumerate People Near Me
    <LI>Wait for changes in the People Near Me
</UL>

<H3>Application Invite</H3>
The Application Invite sample is a simple console base application.  The goal
of the application is to demonstrate proper use of the Collaboration Application
Invite APIs.  Specifically, it demostrates how to:
<UL>
    <LI>Enumerate contacts
    <LI>Enumerate endpoints associated with a contact
    <LI>Register a application
    <LI>Determine if an endpoint has a specific application
    <LI>Send an invitation synchronously
    <LI>Send an invitation asynchronously
</UL>

<H3>Naming APIs</H3>
The Naming APIs samples come in two pieces:
<UL>
    
    <li><b> Email Name Resolution </b><br>

    The Email Name Resolution sample demonstrates how, using Winsock, an application can publish email names through a variety of underlying provider systems.  The sample shows the use of the new winsock api SetAddrInfoEx which can be used to add (or remove) email address / ip address pairs to a naming provider. After an email address has been added to a provider, it may be used in place of hostnames -- for example "ping user@sampleprovider.net" will work.  Note that this is sample is best used in conjunction with the NS_EMAIL Provider sample
    <p>
    <li><b> NS_EMAIL Provider</b> <br>

    A naming provider extends the functionality of winsock such that e-mail addresses may be used in place of hostnames for a particular domain. This sample provider demonstrates adding a new provider for email addresses ending in @sampleprovider.net. After building the provider, use "SampleProvider.Exe /install" to install the provider, then simply run it to have it interact w/ @sampleprovider.net email addresses.
