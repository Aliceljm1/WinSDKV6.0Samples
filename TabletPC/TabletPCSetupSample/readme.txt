Tablet PC Setup Sample
----------------------

This sample demonstrates how to create a Microsoft Visual Studo Deployment Project that installs the redistributable components of the Tablet PC Platform.

NOTE:  If you use this project as a basis for your own installer, you must change the GUIDs for product name and version to prevent conflicts with this and other installation applications.  New guids can be generated using the GUIDGEN utility included with the Microsoft Windows Vista SDK.
