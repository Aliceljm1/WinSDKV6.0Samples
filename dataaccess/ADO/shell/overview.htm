<H2>ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) 2.7 Samples</H2>


<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>For ADO 2.7, all of the ADO samples have been updated to demonstrate new 
features and usage scenarios. They have been integrated within this web 
application to allow easy setup, running and code-browsing. By clicking on a
sample application in the left frame you can view the setup instructions, run 
the sample and view the source code for the sample, all within this browser. 
See the installation information below for details. Each sample is located in 
its own directory, so they may be run outside of this shell as well.</P>

<H3>Installation & Usage</H3>
<P>These samples have been written to require minimal configuration. The goal is to get
developers started with ADO with a minimum of setup overhead.</P>
	<OL>
	<LI>Create a new IIS virtual root called http://localhost/adosamp.</LI>
	<LI>Copy all ADO samples from the Samples\ADO directory to the vroot.</LI>
	<LI>Run http://localhost/adosamp/default.htm (this page).</LI>
	<LI>Follow the on-screen directions to run each sample.</LI>
	</OL>
                  
<H3>System Requirements</H3>
<P>Each sample has its own set of requirements. The samples have been implemented as 
HTML pages, Active Server Pages (ASP), Microsoft Visual Basic client programs, 
Microsoft Visual C++ client programs and one Microsoft Visual C++ ISAPI DLL.</P>

<P>Note: Most ADO samples will run over most OLE DB Providers. Some samples have been 
written to use a specific provider. Sample application requirements will be listed on
each samples setup page.</P>

<P>Please review the SDK Documentation and Release Notes for additional 
information regarding these samples.</P>
