<H2>Using the Data Shape provider</H2>

<H3>Sample Overview</H3>

<P>ADO 2.7 includes the Data Shape Provider (MSDataShape). The Data Shape Provider can be used 
to create hierarchical relationships between recordsets and to perform other shaping functions. </P>

<P> The data shape provider accepts commands in the data shaping language. A typical shape command
consists of a data provider command and a list of appended columns that the Data Shape provider 
will add to the recordset returned by the data provider command.</P>

The types of columns that the Data Shape provider can append to the data provider rowset include: 
<UL type=disc>
  <LI>Chapter columns. A chapter column creates a hierarchical relationship between this recordset 
  and a child recordset.<BR> 

  <LI>Aggregate columns. These columns are the result of performing an aggregate operation, such as SUM or COUNT on 
  the child rows of this row.<BR>

  <LI>CALC columns. CALC columns use the VB expression service to evaluate an expression over 
  columns in this recordset.</LI>

  <LI>NEW columns. NEW columns are fabricated columns that are initially NULL.</LI>
</UL>

<P>An example of a simple shape command that creates a two level hierarchy between an orders table and an order details table is:</P>

<P>SHAPE {select * from Orders} APPEND ({select * from [Order Details]} RELATE OrderID TO OrderID)</P>
