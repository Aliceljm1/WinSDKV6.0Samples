This sample demonstrates the most common developer uses of the new KnownFolder API: defining, registering, enumerating and finding the path for all KnownFolders on your system.  

This sample demonstrates registering a KnownFolder by directly writing the relevant registry keys and values.  This sample showcases only the most common KnownFolder Definition fields and targets developers of managed code who would prefer registry access to COM interop.
